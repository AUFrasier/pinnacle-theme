                    <p>Many people will tell you of a negative experience they’ve had hiring a roofer in the past. Maybe you’ve signed a contract with someone or even paid for roofing services and then had that person skip town. Maybe you’ve had work done that left a lot to be desired, or even left your property in worse shape than it was in to begin with. At the very least you’ve likely seen a roofer leave behind a terrible mess after completing a job. </p>
